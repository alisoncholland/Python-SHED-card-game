# ${1:Python-SHED-card-game}

## This game plays a simplified version of SHED. The goal is to get rid of the cards in your hand. 
## You'll play with one opponent: the computer.
## Rules: Cards can only be played if they are higher or equal to the value of the top card on the table. 
If they are not, you will have to pick up ALL the cards on the table. 
The one who gets rid of all their cards first wins. 

# Installation

## I used Python to create this programme. You can find out how to install and use python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/


# Usage

## Feel free to use whatever code you like. All I kindly ask in return is that you cite it appropriately :)
